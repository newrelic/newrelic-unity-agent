# New Relic Unity Agent

This agent utilizes the native New Relic Android and iOS agents to instrument Unity apps. The New Relic SDKs gather data such as crashes, network traffic, and other relevant information to help monitor and assess the performance of Unity apps.

## Features
* Record and Capture C# errors
* Network Instrumentation
* Distributed Tracing 
* Tracking UnityEngine Debug log, assert and error
* Handled Exception
* Capture interactions and the sequence in which they were created
* Pass user information to New Relic to track user sessions
* Scene Navigation as Interactions
* Capture Native C++ Errors
* offline monitoring of events and exceptions

## Current Support:
- Android API 24+ (AGP 7 and Higher)
- iOS 10
- Depends on New Relic iOS/XCFramework and Android agents

## Installation

1. Scoped Registries allow Unity to communicate the location of any custom package registry server to the Package Manager so that the user has access to several collections of packages at the same time. NewRelic uses Scoped 
   Registries to allow our users to manage, download and install our SDK using the built-in Unity Package Manager.

   In the Package Manager in the Unity IDE, download the NewRelic SDK using add package from git url

   ```
   https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-unity-agent.git
   
   ```

2. Open the NewRelic editor

In your Unity IDE, click Tools → NewRelic → Getting Started to open the NewRelic editor window.
<img width="622" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-13 at 1 07 46 PM" src="https://github.com/ndesai-newrelic/newrelic-unity-agent/assets/89222514/2691a4a0-b0a0-4f4a-8532-f8f1e7975a6e">

3. Update your app information on the editor
   Select Android and enter the App token:

   AppToken is platform-specific. You need to generate the seprate token for Android and iOS apps to get better Visibility at app level.


4. External Dependency Manager support (do not skip this step!)
   If using the Unity External Dependency Manager plug-in, disable the your dependency resolver at the root level in **launcherTemplate.gradle**:

```groovy
 apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
 apply plugin: 'newrelic' // <-- add this
dependencies {
    implementation project(':unityLibrary')
    implementation 'com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-ndk:1.+' 
    implementation 'com.newrelic.agent.android:android-agent:7.2.0' 
    }

android {
    compileSdkVersion **APIVERSION**
    buildToolsVersion '**BUILDTOOLS**'

```

5. Customize Gradle Templates
   If using Unity 2019 or later, add the following to your Gradle files:

   1.Include the New Relic Maven repository URL in the Gradle build settings. To do this, open your **mainTemplate.gradle** file (usually located in Assets/Plugins/Android folder) and add the New Relic Maven URL like this:

```groovy
   allprojects {
    buildscript {
        repositories {**ARTIFACTORYREPOSITORY**
            google()
            jcenter()
            mavenCentral()
        }
```
  2. Add the New Relic classpath to your project-level **baseProjectTemplate.gradle** file (typically located in the android folder in your Unity project):


  ```groovy
        dependencies {
            // If you are changing the Android Gradle Plugin version, make sure it is compatible with the Gradle version preinstalled with Unity
            // See which Gradle version is preinstalled with Unity here https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-gradle-overview.html
            // See official Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin compatibility table here https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle
            // To specify a custom Gradle version in Unity, go to "Preferences > External Tools", uncheck "Gradle Installed with Unity (recommended)" and specify a path to a custom Gradle version
            classpath 'com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:7.3.0'
            **BUILD_SCRIPT_DEPS**
        }
    }


If you are utilizing an older version of Unity Studio, you can incorporate a lower version of the classpath as a dependency which supports AGP7 and lower version of Gradle.

```groovy
        dependencies {
            // If you are changing the Android Gradle Plugin version, make sure it is compatible with the Gradle version preinstalled with Unity
            // See which Gradle version is preinstalled with Unity here https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-gradle-overview.html
            // See official Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin compatibility table here https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle
            // To specify a custom Gradle version in Unity, go to "Preferences > External Tools", uncheck "Gradle Installed with Unity (recommended)" and specify a path to a custom Gradle version
            classpath 'com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:6.11.0'
            **BUILD_SCRIPT_DEPS**
        }
    }

 ```
  By making these changes in your Gradle files, you will ensure that the New Relic artifacts are properly downloaded and included in your Unity project.

6.Make sure your app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your AndroidManifest.xml

 ``` xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  ```

7. Please ensure that your External Dependency Manager settings match the following configuration. In your Unity IDE, navigate to Assets → External Dependency Manager → iOS Resolver → Settings:

   1. Add use_frameworks! to Podfile is unchecked.
   2. Always add the main target to Podfile box is checked.

  <img width="407" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-13 at 1 22 21 PM" src="https://github.com/ndesai-newrelic/newrelic-unity-agent/assets/89222514/5de6fb36-f60d-4470-a1c6-78975d4c4a10">

8. If the Podfile is not being used for iOS dependency management, you can proceed with the following steps.

   1. Download and unzip the New Relic XCFramework SDK
    Download the latest iOS agent from our [iOS agent release notes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes)
   2. Add the New Relic XCFramework to your Xcode project
     Unzip the SDK download, drag the “NewRelicAgent.xcframework” folder from the Finder into your Xcode project (dropping it onto your Targets Frameworks pane). Select “Embed & Sign” under the Embed column.

```C#
    NewRelicAgent.setMaxOfflineStorageSize(200);
```




## How to see C# Errors(Fatal/Non Fatal) in NewRelic One?

C# errors and handled exceptions can be seen in the `Handled Exceptions` tab in New Relic One. You will be able to see the event trail, attributes, and stack trace for each C# error recorded.

You can also build a dashboard for these errors using this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM MobileHandledException SINCE 24 hours ago
```
## Query Unity log data [#logs]

New Relic stores your Unity logs as custom events. You can query these logs and build dashboards for them using this NRQL query:

```nrql
 SELECT * FROM `Mobile Unity Logs` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO
```

For more information on NRQL queries, see [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/#where).
